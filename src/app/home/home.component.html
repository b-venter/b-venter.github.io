        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            SIP has supplanted H.323 ... IP has replaced TDM ... and proprietary hardware has given way to open source: communication technology has moved from <b>copper to cloud</b>, 
            and it has not always been predictable.
        </p>    
        <p>
                I have been involved from the ground up in telecommunications, starting as an apprentice and doing copper cabling for PBX and LAN installations, 
                I have enjoyed working on enterprise communications systems like the Ericsson MD110 up to its present form: Mitel's MXONE. Collaboration tools, contact 
                centers and more have been thrown into the mix. Besides running my own <a href="https://matrix.org/" target=”_blank”>matrix homeserver</a>, I enjoy 
                web development - previously with LAMP, but more recently with Angular, Go and ArangoDB - and continually look to improve my programming 
                ability. In between are many things which catch my curiosity. This blog records all these digital encounters.
